WHAT IS THE PROJECT?

RESPONSIVE PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

The Responsive Portfolio Website is a training project to build responsive website with SCSS. It was my goal to build well functioning portfolio website for myself. It shows different part of my knowledge, experience, projects and contact information. It works with larger and smaller screens.


HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN IT?

You can install the project by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:
git clone https://github.com/Omat-projektit/lut-project.git

Then to install the node_modules run the command: 
npm install

Now you can read the code and make changes. On my behalf you're welcome to use the code, but I ask you not to push any changes to my repository. 


HOW TO USE THE PROJECT?

On your computer you can open up the folder and double click the index.html. First page of the project opens up and you can see some basic information about me. You can go to different pages by click the hamburger menu (three lines) on the right top corner. The menu opens up. 

About:
By clicking About you go to About me page where's my work experience and studies. There are three links which do guide you to the precise part of the page. The link are: My IT work, My other work and My studies. 

Work:
By clicking Work you go to My work page where I've listed my projects and group projects I've taken part of. Under the images there are eye icon and text: Project and Github icon and text: Github. By clicking the eye icon and Project you can see what does that specific project look like. But clicking Github icon and text Github you can see the project's code in my Github. Also if there's mention (frontend) or (backend) after Github text you can see the code in Github specified to frontend code and backend code.
