                    <p>I'm Laura Vikström from Oulu. I'm graduating 
                        next spring from University of Applied 
                        Sciences with business information systems degree.
                        I own strong analytical and problem 
                        solving skills. I am on my best with 
                        front end developing but my strong suit 
                        is also doing visual work, for example 
                        animations. </p>

                <p>I monitored and administrated test automation 
                    tests and investigated if some test was failing.
                    Part of my job also was to improve the test
                    automation so that the tests run faster and 
                    they are more extensive.</p>

                <p>I was in charge of what new tests are taken to test 
                    automation and co-operated with that field's

                <p>I wrote and tested new or failed test automation tests
                    to make sure they work. I made corrections to current tests.
                    I reported the fails when there were some.</p>

                <p>Being tester in test automation required large understanding 
                    of the subjects under testing but also about automation
                    and how the test scripts are written.</p>
